/*
  # Allow Public Read Access for Orders

  ## Overview
  This migration allows anonymous/public read access to orders and order_items.
  The admin API endpoint handles authentication separately, so we need to allow
  the Supabase client to read all orders.

  ## Changes
  1. Add public SELECT policies for orders and order_items
  
  ## Security Notes
  - Authentication is handled at the API route level
  - Only SELECT permission is granted
  - Admin verification happens before data is returned
